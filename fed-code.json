Originally, CAIVRS automated screening was done only through a touch-tone telephone system using a succession of voice response units (VRUs). CAIVRS was created in 1988 for the Office of Housing to check the credit worthiness of applicants for FHA insured loans. Title 31, United States Code, Section 3720B bars â€œdelinquent Federal debtors from obtaining Federal loans or loan insurance guarantees.â€ In 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandated that all Federal Credit agencies prescreen all applicants for non-delinquency in Federal debt, through a system of shared data, where practical. In 1990, CAIVRS expanded to include delinquent Federal borrower data from agencies other than HUD, including; USDA, VA, SBA, FDIC, and the Departments of Education and Justice.

The FASS-FHA system collects annual project financial statement information to assess the project's financial performance and compliance and has accepted and assessed over 78,000 electronic submissions of Annual Financial Statement (AFS) data since October of 1998. It identifies financial risks and compliance deficiencies in need of loss mitigation or enforcement actions by the Office of Housing (Housing) or Enforcement Center (EC).

        "description": "In June 1997, HUD announced it was embarking the most far-reaching and ambitious reform initiatives in its history. The new HUD 2020 Management Reform Plan included, among other changes, the establishment of the Public and Indian Housing - Real Estate Assessment Center (PIH-REAC). PIH-REAC is an information-intensive HUD operation that evaluates the performance of field entities managing or owning housing in which the Department has either a financial interest or a statutory monitoring obligation. (Note that the majority of these properties are public housing or multifamily properties.) As part of this Enterprise-Wide Strategic Plan, HUD made three decisions that require most significant transformations of the FASS-PH program that have ever been undertaken. One decision is that it will take a quantum leap in its effort to improve the granularity of its monitoring of local Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). A second is that it will start using, and eventually migrate all of its stored data to Oracle. Third, it will shift to using an open source, Java-based programming language, often called J2EE (completed). The decision has been made to create a more transparent reporting system that will provide a greater level of granularities at the property level. The objective is to collect expenses and revenues from a Project Based Management (PBM) perspective â€“ specifically by dividing the properties managed by individual Public Housing Agencies/Authorities (PHAs) into more manageable sized groupings called Asset Management Projects (AMPs). To help implement this, HUD will also encourage the creation of a Central Office Cost Center (COCC) for each PHA with more than one AMP. These COCCs (or private management companies) will serve as the vehicle through which a PHA can provide administrative and maintenance services to its AMPs, and through which it can keep an accounting of the expenditures for those services (conversion to AMP completed). As a result of these changes, the FASS-PH software will have to be changed to capture, evaluate and grade the new financial information being submitted by the PHAs. This will require a number of new financial data input screens for PHAs, evaluation screens for Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) Staff, and the back-end processes that drive these and other submission-scoring operations.

REAC developed the Lender Assessment Subsystem (LASS) to automate and improve the process of capturing annual, audited financial and compliance data for HUD approved Non-supervised mortgagees and loan correspondents. The system currently resides under the purview of HUDâ€™s Single Family Housing Office of Lender Activities. The LASS System is a web-based application that collects and assesses financial data from approximately 7,000 Non-supervised Loan Correspondents and Mortgagees. LASS provides FHA personnel with real-time access to risk management information associated with lender and issuer activities related to over $700 billion of mortgage insurance in-force and mortgage-backed securities. The LASS system provides HUD with a comprehensive tool to identify and measure potential risk factors posed by lenders to the insured portfolio. LASS assists in addressing the material weakness identified in FHAâ€™s FY2000 audited financial statement which states that â€œFHA must continue to place more emphasis on early warning and loss prevention for single family insured mortgages. It also addresses concerns expressed in an Inspector General (IG) report, which cited FHA for being lax on lender reviews. The LASS system complies with the requirements of OMB Circulars A-123, â€œInternal Control Systemsâ€ and A-127, â€œFinancial Management Systems.â€ Additionally, it addresses the 24 CFR Part 5, UFRS, Subpart H, Section 5.801 (b) which was amended to state: â€œEntities (or individuals) to which this subpart is applicable must provide to HUD, on an annual basis, such financial information as required by HUD.â€",

These current systems were isolated, unable to communicate with one another, unable to create timely reports, and do not process data quickly. They were not Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) compliant and require manual and intensive processes to work around system weaknesses and to provide critical HR and training information. HIHRTS was designed to select and implement a JFMIP-compliant Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) ERP package that will support HUD in re-engineering and/or replacing its HR and Training information systems, processes, and procedures to eliminate the deficiencies. This system will improve the Department's ability to meet human capital management needs and support enhanced customer service. In 2002, HUD purchased the COTS solution software package, PeopleSoft Human Resources Management System, with plans to implement without customization, to provide the services needed by the Department to automate HR and Training systems.",

Objectives for IOD are that it will: â€¢ Become a central resource for PD&R to analyze emerging trends, issues, and solutions. â€¢ Spur HUD HQ, field, and regional offices to engage with innovations occurring within their jurisdictionâ€“improving participation, a sense of ownership, connectivity, and morale across the agency. â€¢ Engage domestic and international innovators from public, private, and social sectors in sharing best practices and models â€¢ Generate philanthropic interest, collaborations and/or investment. â€¢ Be a meaningful external engagement tool, demonstrating HUD values new approaches and innovative practices in fulfilling its mission. The four components of IOD include: 1. An online submission form and innovations database: Anyone can submit innovations (HUD staff, local governments, multi-lateral organizations, non-profits, or the general public) to IOD though a straightforward submission form. Thereafter, an internal IOD committee will clear submissions for publishing based on established and OGC-approved criteria. Once cleared, innovations will populate a searchable database that can be filtered by HUD goals, major housing and urban development themes, geography, and/or innovation type. 2. Review and Edit Submitted Innovations An internal IOD committee will review all submitted innovations to validate text and photographs of the submissions. This system will be available internally to HUD staff. 3. Featured Innovation: The IOD committee will select key innovations to feature on the HUD.gov homepage slideshow and HUDuser.org, in addition to the Innovation of the Day landing page. These featured innovations will change/rotate on a weekly basis, enabling us to elevate specific innovations. For example, one week we may want to feature innovations related to homelessness, while another week sustainable communities. Additionally, featured innovations will be shared through social media, emails, and partner sitesâ€”the viral nature helping to fuel the overall initiative. 4. Trend Analysis and Dashboard Tool Anyone will be able to query the submitted innovations.

(This feature reduces requirements for employees and supervisors to understand the time and leave rules.) 3.The supervisor or their designee must approve regular and corrected time records prior to transmission of these records to the NFC Payroll/Personnel System. 4.Leave will be requested and approved through an integrated leave module.  System generated E-mail reminder messages will be sent to employees and supervisors when they have missed deadlines for the entry and approval of T&A records.

The home is sold upon the borrowers' death or the loan is repaid via other means, which results in termination of the FHA Insurance. While the loan is active, disbursements are added to the outstanding balance, along with interest and other applicable fees, up to the calculated limit based on the borrowers' age and the property value. The borrower does not make payments as in a conventional loan, but the loan is repaid either to the lender by sale of the property or other re-payment method, or to HUD if the case has become an Assigned Note. An Assigned Note happens when the outstanding balance reaches 98% or more of its limit, at which time, FHA takes over the servicing of the loan, and pays a Claim to the lender to cover their outlays.",

These goals will help improve the agencyâ€™s ability to accurately quantify budgetary data resources, measure program effectiveness, and scrupulously justify the agency s budget formulations and requests. By aligning current and future AH processes, HUD aims to simplify business operations and maximize investment returns with business-driven, service-oriented solutions that employ shared and standardized technology. NGMS will provide an integrated, seamless and singular view of financial and program data used to make real-time business decisions, currently warehoused in disparate data sources. The modernization of affordable housing program data through NGMS will provide HUD executives, Congressional authorizers and appropriators, OMB, public housing agencies, and other stakeholders an enhanced view of HUD s financial accountability. With NGMS' accurate financial data and automated processes, HUD personnel will be able to reduce improper payment errors by identifying operating costs, reserves, and subsidy payment anomalies. Once implemented, NGMS will provide staff with a new set of monitoring, oversight and analysis tools to ensure that allocated federal funds are used efficiently to assist affordable housing participants. NGMS will build project modules across four dimensions: (1) HUD Operations - creating a single point of access to data and key information to reduce HUD s administrative burden; (2) Financial management - developing an automated and more accurate process of budget formulation based on real-time data to reduce errors in budget forecasting; (3) Partner Operations - providing HUD partners with a single point of access to data that will allow them to better serve their customers and operate more efficiently; and (4) Business support - expanding the access and use of the NGMS IT advancements to the HUD enterprise level.",
