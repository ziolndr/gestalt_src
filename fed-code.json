        "description": "In June 1997, HUD announced it was embarking the most far-reaching and ambitious reform initiatives in its history. The new HUD 2020 Management Reform Plan included, among other changes, the establishment of the Public and Indian Housing - Real Estate Assessment Center (PIH-REAC). PIH-REAC is an information-intensive HUD operation that evaluates the performance of field entities managing or owning housing in which the Department has either a financial interest or a statutory monitoring obligation. (Note that the majority of these properties are public housing or multifamily properties.) As part of this Enterprise-Wide Strategic Plan, HUD made three decisions that require most significant transformations of the FASS-PH program that have ever been undertaken. One decision is that it will take a quantum leap in its effort to improve the granularity of its monitoring of local Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). A second is that it will start using, and eventually migrate all of its stored data to Oracle. Third, it will shift to using an open source, Java-based programming language, often called J2EE (completed). The decision has been made to create a more transparent reporting system that will provide a greater level of granularities at the property level. The objective is to collect expenses and revenues from a Project Based Management (PBM) perspective Ã¢â¬â specifically by dividing the properties managed by individual Public Housing Agencies/Authorities (PHAs) into more manageable sized groupings called Asset Management Projects (AMPs). To help implement this, HUD will also encourage the creation of a Central Office Cost Center (COCC) for each PHA with more than one AMP. These COCCs (or private management companies) will serve as the vehicle through which a PHA can provide administrative and maintenance services to its AMPs, and through which it can keep an accounting of the expenditures for those services (conversion to AMP completed). As a result of these changes, the FASS-PH software will have to be changed to capture, evaluate and grade the new financial information being submitted by the PHAs. This will require a number of new financial data input screens for PHAs, evaluation screens for Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) Staff, and the back-end processes that drive these and other submission-scoring operations.

The system currently resides under the purview of HUDÃ¢â¬â¢s Single Family Housing Office of Lender Activities. The LASS System is a web-based application that collects and assesses financial data from approximately 7,000 Non-supervised Loan Correspondents and Mortgagees. LASS provides FHA personnel with real-time access to risk management information associated with lender and issuer activities related to over $700 billion of mortgage insurance in-force and mortgage-backed securities.

Ã¢â¬Â¢ Spur HUD HQ, field, and regional offices to engage with innovations occurring within their jurisdictionÃ¢â¬âimproving participation, a sense of ownership, connectivity, and morale across the agency. Ã¢â¬Â¢ Engage domestic and international innovators from public, private, and social sectors in sharing best practices and models Ã¢â¬Â¢ Generate philanthropic interest, collaborations and/or investment. Ã¢â¬Â¢ Be a meaningful external engagement tool, demonstrating HUD values new approaches and innovative practices in fulfilling its mission. The four components of IOD include: 1. An online submission form and innovations database: Anyone can submit innovations (HUD staff, local governments, multi-lateral organizations, non-profits, or the general public) to IOD though a straightforward submission form. Thereafter, an internal IOD committee will clear submissions for publishing based on established and OGC-approved criteria. Once cleared, innovations will populate a searchable database that can be filtered by HUD goals, major housing and urban development themes, geography, and/or innovation type. 2. Review and Edit Submitted Innovations An internal IOD committee will review all submitted innovations to validate text and photographs of the submissions. This system will be available internally to HUD staff. 3.

The home is sold upon the borrowers' death or the loan is repaid via other means, which results in termination of the FHA Insurance. While the loan is active, disbursements are added to the outstanding balance, along with interest and other applicable fees, up to the calculated limit based on the borrowers' age and the property value. The borrower does not make payments as in a conventional loan, but the loan is repaid either to the lender by sale of the property or other re-payment method, or to HUD if the case has become an Assigned Note. An Assigned Note happens when the outstanding balance reaches 98% or more of its limit, at which time, FHA takes over the servicing of the loan, and pays a Claim to the lender to cover their outlays.",

These goals will help improve the agencyÃ¢â¬â¢s ability to accurately quantify budgetary data resources, measure program effectiveness, and scrupulously justify the agency s budget formulations and requests. By aligning current and future AH processes, HUD aims to simplify business operations and maximize investment returns with business-driven, service-oriented solutions that employ shared and standardized technology. NGMS will provide an integrated, seamless and singular view of financial and program data used to make real-time business decisions, currently warehoused in disparate data sources. The modernization of affordable housing program data through NGMS will provide HUD executives, Congressional authorizers and appropriators, OMB, public housing agencies, and other stakeholders an enhanced view of HUD s financial accountability. With NGMS' accurate financial data and automated processes, HUD personnel will be able to reduce improper payment errors by identifying operating costs, reserves, and subsidy payment anomalies. Once implemented, NGMS will provide staff with a new set of monitoring, oversight and analysis tools to ensure that allocated federal funds are used efficiently to assist affordable housing participants. NGMS will build project modules across four dimensions: (1) HUD Operations - creating a single point of access to data and key information to reduce HUD s administrative burden; (2) Financial management - developing an automated and more accurate process of budget formulation based on real-time data to reduce errors in budget forecasting; (3) Partner Operations - providing HUD partners with a single point of access to data that will allow them to better serve their customers and operate more efficiently; and (4) Business support - expanding the access and use of the NGMS IT advancements to the HUD enterprise level.",

Data from these sources are accessed through the Public and Indian Housing (PIH) Data Warehouse (DW). The PIH data is input by PHAs and later validated and updated within BFF where necessary to create a verified Frozen Dataset. Additionally, user-supplied reference files provide information not available in PIH DW. These reference files are related to Inflation and Administrative factors that are received periodically. That data is aggregated into the BFF database through an Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) process (using Oracle Stored Procedures). The reporting tool, Hyperion Interactive Reporting (IR), accesses the BFF Data Mart and allows users to produce canned reports and output files (such as the Frozen Dataset). The Frozen Dataset is used for the budget formulation purposes. In the future, the Frozen Dataset will be the data source for the Hyperion Planning application. The Frozen Dataset will be loaded into the Essbase cube and used for budget formulation purposes. The BFF users will access Web Forms to interact with the Hyperion Planning application; verify, validate, update, adjust, and run business rules and calculations; and create the Tenant Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) budget (full details of all business rules and calculations may be found in the BFF Requirements Document). Web Forms are unique to the Hyperion Planning module and are similar to Excel worksheets using Pivot Tables.",

These forms are entered into this application, reviewed for validity and eligibility, and then used to pay invoices to childcare providers for qualifying employees. The child care subsidy program provides financial assistance to eligible families to assist with child care costs, and provides financial assistance to employees who have children enrolled, or who will be enrolled, in Licensed or Accredited Family Care Homes or Child Care Centers. Financial Operations and Disbursement Division and the External Services Branch use Child Care Subsidy to pay invoices to childcare providers for employees participating in the child care subsidy program. GSA pays the difference between the the actual costs and the family portion, as long as the actual costs do not exceed the maximum amounts for the most expensive GSA-sponsored child care center in the specified region.",
